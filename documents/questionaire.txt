How many years of experience have you got in developing DL models?

Do you know the environmental implications of training DL models?
- No, not at all.
- I know something about it.
- I know quite well the implications.

When training DL models, do you ever assess the energy consumed or the carbon emissions produced by the training?
- No, never.
- I have done it a few times but not frequently.
- Yes, I frequently do it.

Apart from assessing it, do you ever try to minimize it?
- No, never.
- I have done it a few times but not frequently.
- Yes, I frequently do it.

What software do you usually use to develop DL models:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
- Other (Please specify)

Now you will see a short video about a tool used with TensorFlow to help minimize the environmental impact of training a DL model by interactively changing the mode the training does.

In a scale from 1 to 5, how useful do you think this tool is to assess and monitor the energy consumed and the carbon emissions of DL training?

In a scale from 1 to 5, how effective do you think this tool would be to reduce the energy consumed by DL training?

In a scale from 1 to 5, how easy does it look for you to use this tool?

How much do you think you would need to learn to use this tool and include it on your projects?
- With this video I think I could already include it and use it.
- I think I would need a few tries to get familiar with its implementation and use.
- I think I would need more than that to get to include it on my projects.
